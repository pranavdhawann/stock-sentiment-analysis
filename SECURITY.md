## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your browser and operating system updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits and code reviews

## 🏗️ Security Architecture

### 🔒 Data Protection
